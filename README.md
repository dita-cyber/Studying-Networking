After passing the CompTIA A+, I knew my next goal was the Network+ certification. What I didn’t know was just how long and challenging that journey would be. That was in 2020. I moved across states, lost my job, and soon after, the pandemic hit. With everything shut down and no job prospects in sight, I decided to fully commit to studying. It became the most intense study period of my life, I spent nearly every day immersed in networking for over a year. I started with the official Network+ book and watched countless hours of YouTube videos to understand the concepts. Networking was the most abstract and difficult topic I had encountered—it’s not something you can see, yet it’s the backbone of IT. Understanding how computers communicate felt like I was learning a new language, AGAIN. 

I read and re-read chapters, took detailed notes, and plastered my bathroom mirror and fridge with sticky notes about cable types, common ports, and protocols. After months of preparation, I took practice exams and finally scheduled the real test. I failed! It was my first certification failure, and it hit hard. I felt crushed and considered giving up. But after a few days of reflection, I came up with a new plan. Instead of retaking Network+, I decided to aim even higher and go for the CCNA. Looking back, it was a wild move, but it turned out to be a turning point.

I bought the official CCNA guide and started reading and taking notes. After finishing the books, I went through them again, this time doing labs in Cisco Packet Tracer. That’s when everything clicked. Setting up networks, troubleshooting issues, and watching packets move through the OSI layers in real time was fascinating. I finally saw networking in action. I also tried using GNS3, but my old laptop couldn’t handle it well, so I stuck with Packet Tracer. I spent months building complex labs, creating subnets, configuring routers and switches, and troubleshooting every little issue. I even bought a CCNA practice guide to master the CLI commands. I also had access to some physical devices like Palo Alto Networks 1841, Cisco routers 2960G, 3550, and 3650X and Cisco switches, I used them to practice basic configuration.

Eventually, I took the CCNA exam and not surprising at all, I failed again. But this time, I missed it by just four points. I had no real-world experience, and I had only started studying IT a few months earlier. Honestly, I was proud. I had come so far.

I planned to retake the CCNA, but life had other plans. I had to pause everything to deal with serious personal issues. Nearly a year and a half later, I was in a better place and ready to start again. This time, I took a different approach. Instead of jumping back into studying, I got my first IT job at Geek Squad. A few months later, I moved into a help desk role where I worked with Cisco and Meraki devices. That hands-on experience brought all the theory and lab work to life. I was finally applying what I had learned in real-world scenarios.

I decided to revisit the Network+ certification. I bought the updated book, reviewed everything over two months, took practice exams, and this time I passed! It felt incredibly rewarding to finally achieve a goal I had set years earlier. Just a few weeks later, I landed my first job in cybersecurity and passed the Security+ exam within a month. I never went back to finish the CCNA, as my focus shifted to security, but networking remains my favorite topic in IT.  CCNA again? I don't know, maybe one day?
